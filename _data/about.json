  "para1": "The theme of my life is hero worship. I teach literature for the same reason Homer sang — because these stories matter, and the eternal flames of the heroes within are worthy of spending a lifetime fanning.",
  "para2": "My courses are built around a simple conviction: the great epic poems are not difficult because they are obscure, but because they are deep. Given the right context, the right hierarchical structure, and the right companions for the journey, anyone can read them — and be deeply moved by them.",
  "para3": "The <em>Divine Comedy</em> course is fully built. The <em>Iliad</em> course, for Q2 2026, is imminent. The <em>Aeneid</em> and <em>Paradise Lost</em> follow through the year.",

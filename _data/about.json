  "para2": "My courses are built around a simple conviction: the great epic poems are not difficult because they are obscure, but because they are deep. Given the right context, the right questions, and the right companions for the journey, anyone can read them — and be changed by them.",
  "para3": "The <em>Divine Comedy</em> course is fully built and available. The <em>Iliad</em> course launches Q2 2026. The <em>Aeneid</em> and <em>Paradise Lost</em> follow through the year.",
